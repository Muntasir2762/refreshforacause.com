        <p class="text-center mb-5">
            We’re more than just fundraising – we’re parents who saw a need for a better, more practical way to help organizations raise money. 
            Tired of the usual fundraisers, we wanted something that’s not only easy but also offers lasting value. That’s why we created 
            <strong>Refresh for a Cause</strong>, a simple, effective way to raise funds through water bottle and tumbler sales that everyone can use and appreciate.

            <h2 class="text-center mb-3">How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                When your organization partners with us, you’ll receive <strong>50% of all profits</strong> from each sale, directly supporting your cause. 
                And here’s the best part – you don’t have to handle inventory or distribution. Our hassle-free system ensures that all water bottles and 
                tumblers are shipped directly to each buyer, so your team can stay focused on what matters most.
